# macro-kanban

Kanban macro for XWiki

This macro allows to display a kanban view of data in Application Within Minutes applications.
The data is shown in columns according to a field of the application and each page is viewed as a card.

It is possible to drag and drop pages from one column to another and will automatically update the field for that page.
